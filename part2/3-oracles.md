## 💡 Why Oracles Matter for Protocol Builders

**Why this matters:** DeFi protocols that only swap tokens can derive prices from their own reserves. But the moment you build anything that references the value of an asset — lending (what's the collateral worth?), derivatives (what's the settlement price?), stablecoins (is this position undercollateralized?) — you need external price data.

**The problem:** Blockchains are deterministic and isolated. They can't fetch data from the outside world. Oracles bridge this gap, but in doing so, they become the single most attacked surface in DeFi.

> **Real impact:** Oracle manipulation accounted for [$403 million in losses in 2022](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/oracle-manipulation-attacks-rising/), [$52 million across 37 incidents in 2024](https://threesigma.xyz/blog/exploit/2024-defi-exploits-top-vulnerabilities), and continues to be the second most damaging attack vector after private key compromises.

**Major oracle-related exploits:**
- [Mango Markets](https://rekt.news/mango-markets-rekt/) ($114M, October 2022) — centralized oracle manipulation
- [Polter Finance](https://rekt.news/polter-finance-rekt/) ($12M, July 2024) — Chainlink-Uniswap adapter exploit
- [Cream Finance](https://rekt.news/cream-rekt-2/) ($130M, October 2021) — oracle price manipulation via yUSD
- [Harvest Finance](https://rekt.news/harvest-finance-rekt/) ($24M, October 2020) — TWAP manipulation via flash loans
- [Inverse Finance](https://rekt.news/inverse-finance-rekt/) ($15M, June 2022) — oracle manipulation via Curve pool

If you're building a protocol that uses price data, oracle security is not optional — it's existential.

This module teaches you to consume oracle data safely and understand the attack surface deeply enough to defend against it.

## Oracle Fundamentals and Chainlink Architecture

💻 **Quick Try:**

On a mainnet fork, read a live Chainlink feed in 30 seconds:
```solidity
// In a Foundry test with --fork-url:
AggregatorV3Interface feed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419);
(, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = feed.latestRoundData();
// answer = ETH/USD price with 8 decimals (e.g., 300000000000 = $3,000.00)
// updatedAt = timestamp of last update
// How old is this price? block.timestamp - updatedAt = ??? seconds
// That staleness is the gap your protocol must handle.
```

### 💡 The Oracle Problem

**Why this matters:** Smart contracts execute deterministically — given the same state and input, they always produce the same output. This is a feature (consensus depends on it), but it means contracts can't natively access off-chain data like asset prices, weather, sports scores, or API results.

An oracle is any mechanism that feeds external data into a smart contract. The critical question is always: **who or what can you trust to provide accurate data, and what happens if that trust is violated?**

<a id="oracle-types"></a>
### 💡 Types of Price Oracles

**1. Centralized oracles** — A single entity publishes price data on-chain. Simple, fast, but a single point of failure. If the entity goes down, gets hacked, or acts maliciously, every protocol depending on it breaks.

> **Real impact:** [Mango Markets](https://rekt.news/mango-markets-rekt/) ($114M, October 2022) used FTX/Serum as part of its price source — a centralized exchange that later collapsed. The attacker manipulated Mango's own oracle by trading against himself on low-liquidity markets, inflating collateral value.

**2. On-chain oracles (DEX-based)** — Derive price from AMM reserves. The spot price in a Uniswap pool is `reserve1 / reserve0`. Free to read, no external dependency, but trivially manipulable with a large trade or flash loan.

> **Why this matters:** Using raw spot price as an oracle is essentially asking to be exploited. This is the #1 oracle vulnerability.

> **Real impact:** [Harvest Finance](https://rekt.news/harvest-finance-rekt/) ($24M, October 2020) — attacker flash-loaned USDT and USDC, swapped massively in Curve pools to manipulate price, exploited Harvest's vault share price calculation, then unwound the trade. All in one transaction.

**3. TWAP oracles** — Time-weighted average price computed from on-chain data over a window (e.g., 30 minutes). Resistant to single-block manipulation because the attacker would need to sustain the manipulated price across many blocks.

**Trade-off:** The price lags behind the real market, which can be exploited during high volatility.

> **Used by:** [MakerDAO OSM](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/osm) (Oracle Security Module) uses 1-hour delayed medianized TWAP, [Reflexer RAI](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb) uses Uniswap V2 TWAP, [Liquity LUSD](https://github.com/liquity/dev) uses Chainlink + Tellor fallback.

**4. Decentralized oracle networks (Chainlink, Pyth, Redstone)** — Multiple independent nodes fetch prices from multiple data sources, aggregate them, and publish the result on-chain.

**The most robust option for most use cases**, but introduces latency, update frequency considerations, and trust in the oracle network itself.

> **Real impact:** [Chainlink secures $15B+ in DeFi TVL](https://data.chain.link/) (2024), used by [Aave](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core), [Compound](https://github.com/compound-finance/open-oracle), [Synthetix](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix), and most major protocols.

### 💡 Chainlink Architecture Deep Dive

**Why this matters:** [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is the dominant oracle provider in DeFi, securing hundreds of billions in value. Understanding its architecture is essential.

**Three-layer design:**

**Layer 1: Data providers** — Premium data aggregators (e.g., [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), [Kaiko](https://www.kaiko.com/), [Amberdata](https://www.amberdata.io/)) aggregate raw price data from centralized and decentralized exchanges, filtering for outliers, wash trading, and stale data.

**Layer 2: Chainlink nodes** — Independent node operators fetch data from multiple providers. Each node produces its own price observation. Nodes are selected for reputation, reliability, and stake. The node set for a given feed (e.g., [ETH/USD](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd)) typically includes 15–31 nodes.

**Layer 3: On-chain aggregation** — Nodes submit observations to an on-chain Aggregator contract. The contract computes the **median** of all observations and publishes it as the feed's answer.

> **Why this matters:** The median is key — it's resistant to outliers, meaning a minority of compromised nodes can't skew the result. [Byzantine fault tolerance](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model#aggregation): as long as >50% of nodes are honest, the median reflects reality.

**Offchain Reporting (OCR):** Rather than each node submitting a separate on-chain transaction (expensive), Chainlink uses [OCR](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting): nodes agree on a value off-chain and submit a single aggregated report with all signatures. This dramatically reduces gas costs (~90% reduction vs pre-OCR).

> **Deep dive:** [OCR documentation](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting), [OCR 2.0 announcement](https://blog.chain.link/off-chain-reporting-live-on-mainnet/) (April 2021)

```

**Key trust assumptions:** You trust that (1) >50% of Chainlink nodes are honest (median protects against minority), (2) data sources provide accurate prices (nodes cross-reference multiple sources), (3) the Proxy points to a legitimate Aggregator (Chainlink governance controls this).

#### ⚠️ Oracle Governance Risk

The Proxy layer introduces a trust assumption that's often overlooked: **Chainlink's multisig controls which Aggregator the Proxy points to.** This means Chainlink governance can change the node set, update parameters, or even pause a feed. For most protocols this is acceptable — Chainlink's track record is strong — but it means your protocol inherits this trust dependency.

**What this means in practice:**
- Chainlink can upgrade a feed's Aggregator at any time (new node set, different parameters)
- A feed can be deprecated or decommissioned (Chainlink has [deprecated feeds before](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/deprecating-feeds))
- Your protocol should monitor feed health, not just consume it blindly
- For maximum resilience, dual-oracle patterns (covered later) reduce single-provider dependency

> **🔗 Connection:** This is analogous to the proxy upgrade risk from Part 1 Section 6 — the entity controlling the proxy controls the behavior. In both cases, the mitigation is governance awareness and fallback mechanisms.

**Update triggers:**

Feeds don't update continuously. They update when either condition is met:
- **Deviation threshold:** The off-chain value deviates from the on-chain value by more than X% (typically 0.5% for major pairs, 1% for others)
- **Heartbeat:** A maximum time between updates regardless of price movement (typically 1 hour for major pairs, up to 24 hours for less active feeds)

> **Common pitfall:** Assuming Chainlink prices are real-time. The on-chain price can be up to [deviation threshold] stale at any moment. Your protocol MUST account for this.

> **Example:** [ETH/USD feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd) has 0.5% deviation threshold and 1-hour heartbeat. If ETH price is stable, the feed may not update for the full hour. If ETH drops 0.4%, the feed won't update until the heartbeat expires or deviation crosses 0.5%.

#### 🔍 Deep Dive: Chainlink Update Trigger Timing

```
Real ETH price vs on-chain Chainlink price over time:

Price
$3,030 │          ·  real price
$3,020 │        ·  ·
$3,015 │      ·      · ← deviation hits 0.5% → UPDATE ①
$3,010 │    ·          ─────────── on-chain price jumps to $3,015
$3,000 │──·─────────────           ·  ·  ·  real price stays flat
       │  ↑ on-chain                              · · · ·  · ·
$2,990 │  (stale until
       │   trigger)                                ↑ heartbeat expires
       │                                           UPDATE ② (even though
       └───────────────────────────────────────     price hasn't moved 0.5%)
       0    5min   10min   15min  ...  55min  60min

Two triggers (whichever comes FIRST):
  ① Deviation: |real_price - on_chain_price| / on_chain_price > 0.5%
  ② Heartbeat: time since last update > 1 hour

Your MAX_STALENESS should be: heartbeat + buffer
  ETH/USD: 3600s + 900s = 4500s (1h15m)
  Why buffer? Network congestion can delay the heartbeat update.
```

**On-chain contract structure:**

```
Consumer (your protocol)
    ↓ calls latestRoundData()
Proxy (EACAggregatorProxy)
    ↓ delegates to
Aggregator (AccessControlledOffchainAggregator)
    ↓ receives reports from
Chainlink Node Network
```

The [Proxy layer](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model#proxy) is critical — it allows Chainlink to upgrade the underlying Aggregator (change node set, update parameters) without breaking consumer contracts. Your protocol should always point to the Proxy address, never directly to an Aggregator.

> **Common pitfall:** Hardcoding the Aggregator address instead of using the Proxy. When Chainlink upgrades the feed, your protocol breaks. Always use the proxy address from [Chainlink's feed registry](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses).

### 💡 Alternative Oracle Networks (Awareness)

Chainlink dominates, but other oracle networks are gaining traction:

**Pyth Network** — Originally built for Solana, now cross-chain. Key difference: **pull-based** model. Instead of oracle nodes pushing updates on-chain (Chainlink's model), Pyth publishes price updates to an off-chain data store. Your protocol *pulls* the latest price and posts it on-chain when needed. This means fresher prices (sub-second updates available) and lower cost (you only pay for updates you actually use). Trade-off: your transaction must include the price update, adding calldata cost and complexity. Used by many perp DEXes (GMX, Synthetix on Optimism).

**Redstone** — Modular oracle with three modes: Classic (Chainlink-like push), Core (data attached to transaction calldata — similar to Pyth's pull model), and X (for MEV-protected price delivery). Gaining adoption on L2s. Redstone's Core model is particularly gas-efficient because it avoids on-chain storage of price data between reads.

**Chronicle** — MakerDAO's in-house oracle network. Previously exclusive to MakerDAO, now opening to other protocols. Uses Schnorr signatures for efficient on-chain verification. The most battle-tested oracle for MakerDAO's specific needs, but limited ecosystem adoption outside of Maker/Sky.

<a id="push-vs-pull"></a>
#### 🔍 Deep Dive: Push vs Pull Oracle Architecture

The fundamental architectural difference between Chainlink and Pyth/Redstone is **who pays for and triggers the on-chain update:**

```
PUSH MODEL (Chainlink):
  Chainlink nodes continuously monitor prices off-chain
  When deviation/heartbeat triggers → nodes submit on-chain tx
  Cost: Chainlink pays gas for every update (subsidized by feed sponsors)
  Your protocol: just calls latestRoundData() — price is already there

  ┌─────────┐    auto-push    ┌───────────┐    read     ┌──────────┐
  │ CL Nodes│ ──────────────→ │ Aggregator│ ←────────── │Your Proto│
  └─────────┘                 └───────────┘             └──────────┘
                              (always has a price)

PULL MODEL (Pyth / Redstone):
  Oracle nodes sign price data off-chain and publish to a data service
  Your user's transaction INCLUDES the signed price as calldata
  On-chain contract verifies the signatures and uses the price
  Cost: your user pays calldata gas — but only when actually needed

  ┌─────────┐   publish    ┌──────────┐   fetch    ┌──────────┐
  │Pyth Nodes│ ──────────→ │Off-chain │ ─────────→ │ Frontend │
  └─────────┘              │Data Store│            └────┬─────┘
                           └──────────┘                 │ tx includes
                                                        │ signed price
                           ┌──────────┐    verify  ┌────▼─────┐
                           │Pyth On-  │ ←───────── │Your Proto│
                           │chain Ctr │            └──────────┘
                           └──────────┘
                           (verifies sigs, updates cache)
```

**Why pull-based matters for DeFi:**
- **Fresher prices:** Pyth can deliver sub-second updates (vs Chainlink's 0.5% deviation or 1-hour heartbeat)
- **Cheaper at scale:** You only pay for updates you actually use — critical for L2s where gas costs matter less but calldata costs matter more
- **Trade-off:** More integration complexity — your frontend must fetch and attach the price data, and your contract must handle the case where the user submits stale/missing price data

**Integration pattern (Pyth):**
```solidity
// User's transaction includes price update as calldata
function deposit(uint256 amount, bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData) external payable {
    // 1. Update the on-chain price cache (user pays the update fee)
    uint256 fee = pyth.getUpdateFee(priceUpdateData);
    pyth.updatePriceFeeds{value: fee}(priceUpdateData);

    // 2. Read the now-fresh price
    PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPrice(ethUsdPriceId);

    // 3. Use the price in your logic
    uint256 collateralValue = amount * uint64(price.price) / (10 ** uint8(-price.expo));
    // ... rest of deposit logic
}
```

> **Key insight:** Pull-based oracles shift the freshness guarantee from the oracle network to the application layer. Your protocol decides when it needs a fresh price and requests it. This is why perp DEXes (GMX, Synthetix V3) prefer Pyth — they need a fresh price on every trade, not just when deviation exceeds a threshold.

> **🔗 Connection:** Part 3 Module 2 (Perpetuals) covers Pyth in depth — perp protocols need sub-second price updates that Chainlink's heartbeat model can't provide. Part 3 Module 7 (L2 DeFi) discusses pull-based oracles as a better fit for L2 gas economics.

<a id="lst-oracle"></a>
#### 💡 LST Oracle Challenges (Awareness)

Liquid staking tokens (wstETH, rETH, cbETH) are the #1 collateral type in modern DeFi lending. Pricing them correctly requires **chaining two oracle sources:**

```
wstETH/USD price = wstETH/stETH exchange rate × stETH/ETH market rate × ETH/USD Chainlink feed
```

**Why this is tricky:**

1. **Exchange rate vs market rate:** wstETH has an internal exchange rate against stETH (based on Lido's staking rewards). This rate increases monotonically and is read directly from the [wstETH contract](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.6.12/WstETH.sol). But stETH can trade at a **discount** to ETH on secondary markets (it traded at -5% during the Terra/Luna collapse and -3% during the FTX collapse). If your protocol uses the exchange rate and ignores the market discount, borrowers can deposit stETH valued at par while the market values it lower.

2. **De-peg risk:** A lending protocol that doesn't account for stETH/ETH market deviation could allow borrowing against inflated collateral during a de-peg event — exactly when the protocol is most vulnerable.

3. **The production pattern:** Use the *lower* of the exchange rate and the market rate. Chainlink provides a [stETH/ETH feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/steth-eth) that reflects the market rate. Compare it to the contract exchange rate and use the more conservative value.

```solidity
// Simplified LST oracle pattern
function getWstETHPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 exchangeRate = IWstETH(wstETH).stEthPerToken(); // monotonically increasing
    uint256 marketRate = getChainlinkPrice(stethEthFeed);    // can de-peg
    uint256 ethUsdPrice = getChainlinkPrice(ethUsdFeed);

    // Use the MORE CONSERVATIVE rate
    uint256 effectiveRate = exchangeRate < marketRate ? exchangeRate : marketRate;
    return effectiveRate * ethUsdPrice / 1e18;
}
```

> **🔗 Connection:** Part 3 Module 1 (Liquid Staking) covers LST mechanics and pricing in depth. Module 4 (Lending) covers how Aave handles LST collateral valuation.

<a id="read-aggregator-v3"></a>
### 📖 Read: AggregatorV3Interface

**Source:** [@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol)

The interface your protocol will use:

```solidity
interface AggregatorV3Interface {
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
    function description() external view returns (string memory);
    function version() external view returns (uint256);

    function getRoundData(uint80 _roundId) external view returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    );

    function latestRoundData() external view returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    );
}
```

**Critical fields in `latestRoundData()`:**
- `answer` — the price, as an `int256` (can be negative for some feeds). For ETH/USD with 8 decimals, a value of `300000000000` means $3,000.00.
- `updatedAt` — timestamp of the last update. Your protocol MUST check this for staleness.
- `roundId` — the round identifier. Used for historical data lookups.
- `decimals()` — the number of decimal places in `answer`. Do NOT hardcode this. Different feeds use different decimals (most price feeds use 8, but ETH-denominated feeds use 18).

> **Common pitfall:** Hardcoding `decimals` to 8. Some feeds use 18 decimals (e.g., [BTC/ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/btc-eth) — price of BTC denominated in ETH). Always call `decimals()` dynamically.

> **Used by:** [Aave V3 AaveOracle](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/misc/AaveOracle.sol#L107), [Compound V3 price feeds](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/main/contracts/Comet.sol#L1095), [Synthetix ExchangeRates](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/ExchangeRates.sol)

#### 📖 How to Study Oracle Integration in Production Code

When reading how a production protocol consumes oracle data:

1. **Find the oracle wrapper contract** — Most protocols don't call Chainlink directly from core logic. Look for a dedicated oracle contract (e.g., Aave's `AaveOracle.sol`, Compound's price feed configuration in `Comet.sol`). This wrapper centralizes feed addresses, decimal normalization, and staleness checks.

2. **Trace the price from consumer to feed** — Start at the function that uses the price (e.g., `getCollateralValue()` or `isLiquidatable()`) and follow backward: what calls what? How is the raw `int256 answer` transformed into the final `uint256 price` the protocol uses? Map the decimal conversions at each step.

3. **Check what validations exist** — Look for: `answer > 0`, `updatedAt` staleness check, `answeredInRound >= roundId`, sequencer uptime check (L2). Count which checks are present and which are missing — auditors flag missing checks constantly.

4. **Compare two protocols' approaches** — Read [Aave's AaveOracle.sol](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/misc/AaveOracle.sol) and [Liquity's PriceFeed.sol](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/PriceFeed.sol) side by side. Aave uses a single Chainlink source per asset with governance fallback. Liquity uses Chainlink primary + Tellor fallback with automatic switching. Notice the trade-offs: simplicity vs resilience.

5. **Study the fallback/failure paths** — What happens when the primary oracle fails? Does the protocol pause? Switch to a backup? Revert? Liquity's 5-state fallback machine is the most thorough example.

**Don't get stuck on:** The OCR aggregation mechanics (how nodes agree off-chain). That's Chainlink's internal concern. Focus on what your protocol controls: which feed to use, how to validate the answer, and what to do when the feed fails.

### 🛠️ Build: Safe Chainlink Consumer

**Workspace:** [`workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise1-oracle-consumer/`](../workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise1-oracle-consumer/) — starter file: [`OracleConsumer.sol`](../workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise1-oracle-consumer/OracleConsumer.sol), tests: [`OracleConsumer.t.sol`](../workspace/test/part2/module3/exercise1-oracle-consumer/OracleConsumer.t.sol)

**Exercise 1: Build an `OracleConsumer.sol`** that reads Chainlink price feeds with proper safety checks:

```solidity
// ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive safety checks
function getPrice(address feed) public view returns (uint256) {
    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(feed);
    (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

    // CHECK 1: Answer is positive
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");

    // CHECK 2: Round is complete
    require(updatedAt > 0, "Round not complete");

    // CHECK 3: Data is not stale
    require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < MAX_STALENESS, "Stale price");

    // Optional CHECK 4: answeredInRound >= roundId
    // Ensures the round is finalized and not from a previous round
    require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale round");

    return uint256(answer);
}
```

**All three checks are mandatory.** Protocols that skip any of them have been exploited. The staleness check is the most commonly omitted — and the most dangerous.

> **Real impact:** [Venus Protocol on BSC](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/) ($11M, May 2023) — oracle didn't update for hours due to BSC network issues, allowed borrowing against stale collateral prices.

> **Common pitfall:** Setting `MAX_STALENESS` too loosely. If the feed heartbeat is 1 hour, setting `MAX_STALENESS = 24 hours` defeats the purpose. Use `heartbeat + buffer` (e.g., 1 hour + 15 minutes = 4500 seconds).

**Exercise 2: Multi-feed price derivation.** Build a function that computes ETH/EUR by combining [ETH/USD](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd) and [EUR/USD](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eur-usd) feeds. Handle decimal normalization (both feeds may have different `decimals()` values).

```solidity
// Compute ETH/EUR from ETH/USD and EUR/USD
function getETHEURPrice(address ethUsdFeed, address eurUsdFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 ethUsdPrice = getPrice(ethUsdFeed);
    uint256 ethUsdDecimals = AggregatorV3Interface(ethUsdFeed).decimals();

    uint256 eurUsdPrice = getPrice(eurUsdFeed);
    uint256 eurUsdDecimals = AggregatorV3Interface(eurUsdFeed).decimals();

    // ETH/EUR = (ETH/USD) / (EUR/USD)
    // Normalize decimals to avoid precision loss
    uint256 ethEurPrice = (ethUsdPrice * 10**eurUsdDecimals) / eurUsdPrice;

    return ethEurPrice; // Price in EUR with ethUsdDecimals decimals
}
```

> **Common pitfall:** Not accounting for different decimal bases when combining feeds. This can cause 10^10 errors in calculations.

**Exercise 3: L2 sequencer check.** On L2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base), the sequencer can go down. During downtime, Chainlink feeds appear fresh but may be using stale data. Chainlink provides [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds). Build a consumer that checks sequencer status before reading price data:

```solidity
// ✅ GOOD: Check L2 sequencer status before reading price
function isSequencerUp(address sequencerFeed) internal view returns (bool) {
    (, int256 answer, , uint256 startedAt, ) =
        AggregatorV3Interface(sequencerFeed).latestRoundData();

    // answer == 0 means sequencer is up, 1 means it's down
    bool isUp = answer == 0;
    require(isUp, "Sequencer down");

    // Even if up, enforce a grace period after recovery
    // to let feeds catch up to real prices
    uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
    require(timeSinceUp > GRACE_PERIOD, "Grace period not over");

    return true;
}
```

> **Why this matters:** When an L2 sequencer goes down, transactions stop processing. Chainlink feeds on L2 rely on the sequencer to post updates. If the sequencer is down for hours, the last posted price may be very stale even if `updatedAt` appears recent (relative to L2 time). [Arbitrum sequencer uptime feed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum).

> **Used by:** [Aave V3 on Arbitrum](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/misc/AaveOracle.sol) checks sequencer uptime, [GMX V2](https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics) on Arbitrum and Avalanche

**Exercise 4: Foundry tests using mainnet fork.** Fork Ethereum mainnet with `forge test --fork-url <RPC>` and read real Chainlink feeds. Verify your consumer returns sane values for [ETH/USD](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd), [BTC/USD](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/btc-usd). Use `vm.warp()` to simulate staleness conditions and verify your checks revert correctly.

```solidity
function testStalenessCheck() public {
    vm.createSelectFork(mainnetRpcUrl);
    address ethUsdFeed = 0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419; // ETH/USD mainnet

    // Should work with fresh data
    uint256 price = oracle.getPrice(ethUsdFeed);
    assertGt(price, 0);

    // Fast forward past staleness threshold
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + MAX_STALENESS + 1);

    // Should revert due to staleness
    vm.expectRevert("Stale price");
    oracle.getPrice(ethUsdFeed);
}
```

#### 💼 Job Market Context

**What DeFi teams expect you to know:**

1. **"What checks do you perform when reading a Chainlink price feed?"**
   - Good answer: Check that the price is positive and the data isn't stale
   - Great answer: Four mandatory checks: (1) `answer > 0` — invalid/negative prices crash your math, (2) `updatedAt > 0` — round is complete, (3) `block.timestamp - updatedAt < heartbeat + buffer` — staleness, (4) `answeredInRound >= roundId` — stale round. On L2, also check the sequencer uptime feed and enforce a grace period after restart. Set `MAX_STALENESS` based on the specific feed's heartbeat, not a generic value.

2. **"Why can't you use a DEX spot price as an oracle?"**
   - Good answer: It can be manipulated with a flash loan
   - Great answer: A flash loan gives any attacker unlimited temporary capital at zero cost. They can move the spot price `reserve1/reserve0` by any amount within a single transaction, exploit your protocol's reaction to that price, and restore it — all atomically. The cost is just gas. Chainlink is immune because its price is aggregated off-chain across multiple data sources. TWAPs resist single-block manipulation because the attacker needs to sustain the price across the entire window.

**Interview Red Flags:**
- 🚩 Not checking staleness on Chainlink feeds (the most commonly missed check)
- 🚩 Hardcoding `decimals` to 8 (some feeds use 18)
- 🚩 Not knowing about L2 sequencer uptime feeds when discussing L2 deployments
- 🚩 Using `balanceOf` or DEX reserves as a price source

**Pro tip:** In a security review or interview, the first thing to check in any protocol is the oracle integration. Trace where prices come from, what validations exist, and what happens when the oracle fails. If you can identify a missing staleness check or a spot-price dependency, you've found the most common class of DeFi vulnerabilities.

- Alternative oracles: Pyth (pull-based), Redstone (modular), Chronicle (MakerDAO)
- Push vs pull architecture: who pays for updates, freshness vs complexity trade-off
- LST oracle challenges: chaining exchange rate + market rate, de-peg protection
- `AggregatorV3Interface`: `latestRoundData()`, mandatory safety checks (positive, complete, fresh)
- L2 sequencer uptime feeds and grace period pattern

## TWAP Oracles and On-Chain Price Sources

💻 **Quick Try:**

On a mainnet fork, read a live Uniswap V3 TWAP in 30 seconds:
```solidity
// In a Foundry test with --fork-url:
IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(0x88e6A0c2dDD26FEEb64F039a2c41296FcB3f5640); // USDC/ETH 0.05%
uint32[] memory secondsAgos = new uint32[](2);
secondsAgos[0] = 1800; // 30 minutes ago
secondsAgos[1] = 0;    // now
(int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = pool.observe(secondsAgos);
int56 tickDelta = tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0];
int24 twapTick = int24(tickDelta / 1800);
// twapTick ≈ the geometric mean tick over the last 30 minutes
// Compare to pool.slot0().tick (current spot tick) — how far apart are they?
```

### 💡 TWAP: Time-Weighted Average Price

You studied TWAP briefly in Module 2 (Uniswap V2's cumulative price accumulators). Now let's go deeper into when and how to use TWAP oracles.

**How TWAP works:**

A TWAP oracle doesn't store prices directly. Instead, it stores a *cumulative price* that increases over time:

```
priceCumulative(t) = Σ(price_i × duration_i)  for all periods up to time t
```

To get the average price between time `t1` and `t2`:

```
TWAP = (priceCumulative(t2) - priceCumulative(t1)) / (t2 - t1)
```

**The key property:** A flash loan attacker can manipulate the spot price for one block, but that only affects the cumulative sum for ~12 seconds (one block). Over a 30-minute TWAP window, one manipulated block contributes only ~0.7% of the average. The attacker would need to sustain the manipulation for the entire window — which means holding a massive position across many blocks, paying gas, and taking on enormous market risk.

**Uniswap V2 TWAP:**
- [`price0CumulativeLast` / `price1CumulativeLast`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L79) in the pair contract
- Updated on every `swap()`, `mint()`, or `burn()`
- Uses [UQ112.112 fixed-point](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UQ112x112.sol) for precision
- The cumulative values are designed to overflow safely (unsigned integer wrapping)
- External contracts must snapshot these values at two points in time and compute the difference

> **Used by:** [MakerDAO OSM](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/osm) uses medianized V2 TWAP, [Reflexer RAI](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-fsm) uses V2 TWAP with 1-hour delay

<a id="uq112"></a>
#### 🔍 Deep Dive: UQ112.112 Fixed-Point Encoding

Uniswap V2 stores cumulative prices in a custom fixed-point format called **UQ112.112** — an unsigned 224-bit number where 112 bits are the integer part and 112 bits are the fractional part. This is packed into a `uint256`.

```
uint256 (256 bits total):
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  32 bits unused   │  112 bits integer  │  112 bits fraction  │
│  (overflow room)  │  (whole number)    │  (decimal part)     │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ◄────────── 224 bits UQ112.112 ──────────►
```

**Why this format?** Reserves are stored as `uint112` (max ~5.2 × 10^33). The price ratio `reserve1 / reserve0` could be fractional (e.g., 0.0003 ETH per USDC). To represent this without losing precision, Uniswap scales the numerator by 2^112 before dividing:

```solidity
// From UQ112x112.sol:
uint224 constant Q112 = 2**112;

// Encoding a price:
// price = reserve1 / reserve0
// UQ112.112 price = (reserve1 * 2^112) / reserve0
uint224 priceUQ = uint224((uint256(reserve1) * Q112) / reserve0);
```

**Step-by-step with real numbers:**
```
Pool: 1000 USDC (reserve0) / 0.5 ETH (reserve1)
Spot price of ETH = 1000 / 0.5 = 2000 USDC/ETH
2^112 = 5,192,296,858,534,827,628,530,496,329,220,096

In UQ112.112:
  price0 (token1 per token0) = (0.5 × 2^112) / 1000
       = 0.0005 × 2^112
       = 2,596,148,429,267,413,814,265,248,164,610  (raw value)

  price1 (token0 per token1) = (1000 × 2^112) / 0.5
       = 2000 × 2^112
       = 10,384,593,717,069,655,257,060,992,658,440,192,000  (raw value)
```

**Decoding (the `>> 112` you see in TWAP code):**
```solidity
// In the TWAP consult function:
uint256 priceAverage = (priceCumulative - priceCumulativeLast) / timeElapsed;
amountOut = (amountIn * priceAverage) >> 112;
//                                    ^^^^^^
// >> 112 removes the 2^112 scaling factor
// equivalent to: amountIn * priceAverage / 2^112
// This converts from UQ112.112 back to a regular integer
```

**Why the 32-bit overflow room matters:** The cumulative price is `Σ(price × duration)`. Over time, this sum grows without bound. The 32 extra bits (256 - 224) provide overflow room. Uniswap V2 is designed so that cumulative prices can safely overflow `uint256` — the *difference* between two snapshots is still correct because unsigned integer subtraction wraps correctly.

> **Testing your understanding:** If `price0CumulativeLast` at time T1 is `X` and at time T2 is `Y`, the TWAP is `(Y - X) / (T2 - T1)`. Even if `Y` has overflowed past `uint256.max` and wrapped around, the subtraction `Y - X` in unchecked arithmetic still gives the correct delta. This is why Solidity 0.8.x code must use `unchecked { }` for cumulative price math.

**Uniswap V3 TWAP:**
- More sophisticated: uses an [`observations` array](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Oracle.sol) (ring buffer) storing `(timestamp, tickCumulative, liquidityCumulative)`
- Can return TWAP for any window up to the observation buffer length
- Built-in [`observe()` function](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L188) computes TWAP ticks directly
- The TWAP is in tick space (geometric mean), not arithmetic mean — more resistant to manipulation

> **Why this matters:** Geometric mean TWAP is harder to manipulate than arithmetic mean. An attacker who moves the price by 100x for 1 second and 0.01x for 1 second averages to 1x in geometric mean (√(100 × 0.01) = 1), but 50x in arithmetic mean ((100 + 0.01)/2 ≈ 50).

> **Deep dive:** [Uniswap V3 oracle documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/oracle), [V3 Math Primer Part 2](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v3-math-primer-2)

**V4 TWAP:**
- V4 removed the built-in oracle. TWAP is now implemented via hooks (e.g., the [Geomean Oracle hook](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/blob/example-contracts/contracts/hooks/examples/GeomeanOracle.sol)).
- This gives more flexibility but means protocols need to find or build the appropriate hook.

### 📋 When to Use TWAP vs Chainlink

| Factor | Chainlink | TWAP |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Manipulation resistance | High (off-chain aggregation) | Medium (sustained multi-block attack needed) |
| Latency | Medium (heartbeat + deviation) | High (window size = lag) |
| Cost | Free to read, someone else pays for updates | Free to read, relies on pool activity |
| Coverage | Broad (hundreds of pairs) | Only pairs with sufficient on-chain liquidity |
| Centralization risk | Moderate (node operator trust) | Low (fully on-chain) |
| Best for | Lending, liquidations, anything high-stakes | Supplementary checks, fallback, low-cap tokens |

**The production pattern:** Most serious protocols use Chainlink as the primary oracle and TWAP as a secondary check or fallback. If Chainlink reports a price that deviates significantly from the TWAP, the protocol can pause or flag the discrepancy.

> **Used by:** [Liquity](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/PriceFeed.sol) uses Chainlink primary + Tellor fallback, [Maker's OSM](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/osm) uses delayed TWAP, [Euler](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/blob/master/contracts/modules/RiskManager.sol) used Uniswap V3 TWAP (before Euler relaunch).

### 🛠️ Build: TWAP Oracle

**Workspace:** [`workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise2-twap-oracle/`](../workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise2-twap-oracle/) — starter file: [`TWAPOracle.sol`](../workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise2-twap-oracle/TWAPOracle.sol), tests: [`TWAPOracle.t.sol`](../workspace/test/part2/module3/exercise2-twap-oracle/TWAPOracle.t.sol) | Also: [`DualOracle.sol`](../workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise3-dual-oracle/DualOracle.sol), tests: [`DualOracle.t.sol`](../workspace/test/part2/module3/exercise3-dual-oracle/DualOracle.t.sol)

**Exercise 1: Build a TWAP oracle contract** that:
- Stores periodic price observations (price, timestamp) from a Uniswap V2 pair
- Exposes a `consult()` function that returns the TWAP over a configurable window
- Handles the case where insufficient observations exist (revert with clear error)
- Uses proper fixed-point arithmetic to avoid precision loss

```solidity
// Example: Simple TWAP oracle for Uniswap V2
contract SimpleTWAP {
    IUniswapV2Pair public pair;
    uint256 public price0CumulativeLast;
    uint256 public price1CumulativeLast;
    uint32 public blockTimestampLast;

    function update() external {
        (uint256 price0Cumulative, uint256 price1Cumulative, uint32 blockTimestamp) =
            UniswapV2OracleLibrary.currentCumulativePrices(address(pair));

        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;
        require(timeElapsed >= PERIOD, "Period not elapsed");

        price0CumulativeLast = price0Cumulative;
        price1CumulativeLast = price1Cumulative;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
    }

    function consult(address token, uint256 amountIn) external view returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        (uint256 price0Cumulative, uint256 price1Cumulative, uint32 blockTimestamp) =
            UniswapV2OracleLibrary.currentCumulativePrices(address(pair));

        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;
        require(timeElapsed >= MINIMUM_WINDOW, "Window too short");

        uint256 priceCumulative = (token == pair.token0()) ? price0Cumulative : price1Cumulative;
        uint256 priceCumulativeLast = (token == pair.token0()) ? price0CumulativeLast : price1CumulativeLast;

        // TWAP = ΔpriceCumulative / Δtime
        uint256 priceAverage = (priceCumulative - priceCumulativeLast) / timeElapsed;
        amountOut = (amountIn * priceAverage) >> 112; // UQ112.112 fixed-point division
    }
}
```

> **Common pitfall:** Not enforcing a minimum window size. If `timeElapsed` is very small (e.g., 1 block), the TWAP degenerates to near-spot price and becomes manipulable.

**Exercise 2: Compare TWAP to spot.** Deploy a pool, execute swaps that move the price dramatically, then compare the TWAP (over 10 blocks) to the current spot price. Verify the TWAP lags behind the spot — this lag is the trade-off for manipulation resistance.

**Exercise 3: Dual oracle pattern.** Build a `DualOracle.sol` that:
- Reads Chainlink as the primary source
- Reads TWAP as the secondary source
- Reverts if the two sources disagree by more than a configurable threshold (e.g., 5%)
- Falls back to TWAP if the Chainlink feed is stale
- Emits an event when switching sources

```solidity
// ✅ GOOD: Dual oracle with fallback
function getPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 chainlinkPrice;
    bool chainlinkFresh = true;

    try this.getChainlinkPrice() returns (uint256 price) {
        chainlinkPrice = price;
    } catch {
        chainlinkFresh = false;
    }

    uint256 twapPrice = getTWAPPrice();

    if (chainlinkFresh) {
        // Verify Chainlink and TWAP agree
        uint256 deviation = chainlinkPrice > twapPrice
            ? (chainlinkPrice - twapPrice) * 100 / twapPrice
            : (twapPrice - chainlinkPrice) * 100 / chainlinkPrice;

        require(deviation <= MAX_DEVIATION, "Oracle mismatch");
        return chainlinkPrice; // Use Chainlink as primary
    } else {
        emit FallbackToTWAP();
        return twapPrice; // Fallback to TWAP
    }
}
```

This dual-oracle pattern is used in production by protocols like [Liquity](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/PriceFeed.sol).

#### 🔍 Deep Dive: Liquity's Oracle State Machine (5 States)

Liquity's `PriceFeed.sol` is the most thorough oracle fallback implementation in DeFi. It manages 5 states:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐

                     ▼                     ▼
              ┌──────────────────────────────┐
              │  Back to state 0 or 1        │
              │  (with freshness checks)     │
              └──────────────────────────────┘

State transitions triggered by:
  - Chainlink returning 0 or negative price
  - Chainlink stale (updatedAt too old)
  - Chainlink price deviates >50% from previous
  - Tellor frozen (no update in 4+ hours)
  - Tellor price deviates >50% from Chainlink
```

**Why this matters:** Most protocols have one oracle and hope it works. Liquity's state machine handles every combination of oracle failure gracefully. When you build your Part 3 capstone stablecoin, you'll need similar robustness.

## Oracle Manipulation Attacks

<a id="attack-surface"></a>
### ⚠️ The Attack Surface

**Why this matters:** Oracle manipulation is a category of attacks where the attacker corrupts the price data that a protocol relies on, then exploits the protocol's reaction to the false price. The protocol code executes correctly — it just operates on poisoned inputs.

> **Real impact:** Oracle manipulation is responsible for more DeFi losses than any other attack vector except private key compromises. Understanding these attacks is not optional for protocol developers.

---

<a id="spot-manipulation"></a>
### ⚠️ Attack Pattern 1: Spot Price Manipulation via Flash Loan

**This is the most common oracle attack.** The target: any protocol that reads spot price from a DEX pool.

**The attack flow:**

1. Attacker takes a flash loan of Token A (millions of dollars worth)
2. Attacker swaps Token A → Token B in a DEX pool, massively moving the spot price
3. Attacker interacts with the victim protocol, which reads the manipulated spot price
   - If lending protocol: deposit Token B as collateral (now valued at inflated price), borrow other assets far exceeding collateral's true value
   - If vault: trigger favorable exchange rate calculation
4. Attacker swaps Token B back → Token A in the DEX, restoring the price
5. Attacker repays the flash loan
6. **All within a single transaction** — profit extracted, protocol drained

**Why it works:** The victim protocol uses `reserve1 / reserve0` (spot price) as its oracle. A flash loan can move this ratio arbitrarily within a single block, and the protocol reads it in the same block.

> **Real impact:** [Harvest Finance](https://rekt.news/harvest-finance-rekt/) ($24M, October 2020) — attacker flash-loaned USDT and USDC, swapped massively in Curve pools to manipulate price, exploited Harvest's vault share price calculation (which used Curve pool reserves), then unwound the trade. Loss: $24M.

> **Real impact:** [Cream Finance](https://rekt.news/cream-rekt-2/) ($130M, October 2021) — attacker flash-loaned yUSD, manipulated Curve pool price oracle that Cream used for collateral valuation, borrowed against inflated collateral. Loss: $130M.

> **Real impact:** [Inverse Finance](https://rekt.news/inverse-finance-rekt/) ($15M, June 2022) — attacker manipulated Curve pool oracle (used by Inverse for collateral pricing), deposited INV at inflated value, borrowed stables. Loss: $15.6M.

**Example code (VULNERABLE):**

```solidity
// ❌ VULNERABLE: Using spot price as oracle
function getCollateralValue(address token, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
    IUniswapV2Pair pair = IUniswapV2Pair(getPair(token, WETH));
    (uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1, ) = pair.getReserves();

    // Spot price = reserve1 / reserve0
    uint256 price = (reserve1 * 1e18) / reserve0;
    return amount * price / 1e18;
}
```

**This code will be exploited.** Do not use spot price as an oracle.

### ⚠️ Attack Pattern 2: TWAP Manipulation (Multi-Block)

TWAP oracles resist single-block attacks, but they're not immune. An attacker with sufficient capital (or who can bribe block producers) can sustain a manipulated price across the TWAP window.

**The economics:** To manipulate a 30-minute TWAP by 10%, the attacker needs to sustain a 10% price deviation for 150 blocks (at 12s/block). This means holding a massive position that continuously loses to arbitrageurs. The cost of the attack = arbitrageur profits + opportunity cost + gas. For high-liquidity pools, this cost is prohibitive. For low-liquidity pools, it can be economical.

> **Real impact:** While single-transaction TWAP manipulation is rare, low-liquidity pools with short TWAP windows have been exploited. [Rari Capital Fuse](https://rekt.news/rari-capital-rekt/) ($80M, May 2022) — though primarily a reentrancy exploit, used oracle manipulation on low-liquidity pairs.

**Multi-block MEV:** With validator-level access (e.g., block builder who controls consecutive blocks), TWAP manipulation becomes cheaper because the attacker can exclude arbitrageur transactions. This is an active area of research and concern.

> **Deep dive:** [Flashbots MEV research](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research), [Multi-block MEV](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/multi-block-mev/457)

#### 🔍 Deep Dive: TWAP Manipulation Cost — Step by Step

```
Scenario: Manipulate a 30-minute TWAP by 10% on a $10M TVL pool

Pool: ETH/USDC, 1,667 ETH + 5,000,000 USDC (ETH at $3,000)
  k = 1,667 × 5,000,000 = 8,333,333,333
Target: make TWAP report ETH at $3,300 instead of $3,000 (10% inflation)
Window: 30 minutes = 150 blocks (at 12s/block)

To sustain 10% price deviation for the ENTIRE 30-minute window:
  1. Need to move spot price to ~$3,300
     → Swap ~$244K USDC into the pool (buying ETH)
     → Pool now: 5,244,000 USDC + 1,589 ETH → spot ≈ $3,300
     (USDC reserves UP because attacker added USDC, ETH reserves DOWN)

  2. Hold that position for 150 blocks
     → Arbitrageurs see the mispricing and trade against you
     → Each block, arbs take ~$1.5K profit restoring the price
     → You must re-swap each block to maintain $3,300

  3. Cost per block: ~$1,500 (lost to arbitrageurs)
     Cost for 150 blocks: ~$225,000
     Plus: initial capital at risk (~$244K in the pool)
     Plus: gas for 150 re-swap transactions

Total attack cost: ~$300,000-500,000 to shift a 30-min TWAP by 10%

Is it worth it?
  The attacker needs to extract MORE than $300K-500K from the victim
  protocol during the TWAP manipulation window. For a $10M TVL pool,
  this is extremely expensive relative to potential gain.

  For a $100K TVL pool? Cost drops ~100x → TWAP manipulation is viable.
  This is why TWAP oracles are only safe for sufficiently liquid pools.
```

> **🔗 Connection:** Multi-block MEV (Part 3 Module 5) makes TWAP manipulation cheaper if a block builder controls consecutive blocks. This is an active area of concern for TWAP-dependent protocols.

<a id="stale-oracle"></a>
### ⚠️ Attack Pattern 3: Stale Oracle Exploitation

If a Chainlink feed hasn't updated (due to network congestion, gas price spikes, or feed misconfiguration), the on-chain price may lag significantly behind the real market price. An attacker can exploit the stale price:

- If the real price of ETH has dropped 20% but the oracle still shows the old price, the attacker can deposit ETH as collateral at the stale (higher) valuation and borrow against it
- When the oracle finally updates, the position is undercollateralized, and the protocol absorbs the loss

**This is why your staleness check from the Oracle Fundamentals section is critical.**

> **Real impact:** [Venus Protocol on BSC](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/) ($11M, May 2023) — Binance Smart Chain network issues caused Chainlink oracles to stop updating for hours. Attacker borrowed against stale collateral prices. When prices updated, positions were deeply undercollateralized. Loss: $11M.

> **Real impact:** [Arbitrum sequencer downtime](https://status.arbitrum.io/) (December 2023) — 78-minute sequencer outage. Protocols without sequencer uptime checks could have been exploited (none were, but it demonstrated the risk).

---

<a id="donation-manipulation"></a>
### ⚠️ Attack Pattern 4: Donation/Direct Balance Manipulation

Some protocols calculate prices based on internal token balances (e.g., vault share prices based on `totalAssets() / totalShares()`). An attacker can send tokens directly to the contract (bypassing `deposit()`), inflating the perceived value per share. This is related to the "inflation attack" on [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) vaults (covered in Module 7).

> **Real impact:** [Euler Finance](https://rekt.news/euler-rekt/) ($197M, March 2023) — though primarily a donation attack exploiting incorrect health factor calculations, demonstrated how direct balance manipulation can bypass protocol accounting. Loss: $197M.

**Example (VULNERABLE):**

```solidity
// ❌ VULNERABLE: Using balance for price calculation
function getPricePerShare() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalAssets = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 totalShares = totalSupply;
    return totalAssets * 1e18 / totalShares;
}
```

Attacker can donate tokens directly, inflating `totalAssets` without minting shares.

### 💡 Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) — Awareness

**Oracle Extractable Value (OEV)** is the value that can be captured by controlling the *timing* or *ordering* of oracle updates. It's the oracle-specific subset of MEV.

**How it works:** When a Chainlink price update crosses a liquidation threshold, the first transaction to call `liquidate()` after the update profits. Searchers compete to backrun oracle updates, paying priority fees to block builders. The protocol and its users see none of this value — it leaks to the MEV supply chain.

**The scale:** On Aave V3 alone, oracle updates trigger hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidations annually. The MEV extracted from backrunning these updates is estimated at tens of millions per year.

**Emerging solutions:**
- **API3 OEV Network** — An auction where searchers bid for the right to update oracle prices. The auction revenue flows back to the dApp instead of to block builders.
- **Pyth Express Relay** — Similar concept: searchers bid for priority access to use Pyth price updates, with proceeds shared with the protocol.
- **UMA Oval** — Wraps Chainlink feeds so that oracle update MEV is captured via a MEV-Share-style auction and returned to the protocol.

> **Why this matters for protocol builders:** If your protocol triggers liquidations or other value-creating events based on oracle updates, you're leaking value to MEV searchers. As OEV solutions mature, integrating them becomes a competitive advantage — your protocol captures value that would otherwise be extracted.

> **🔗 Connection:** Module 8 (Security) covers MEV threat modeling broadly. Part 3 Module 5 (MEV) covers the full MEV supply chain including OEV in depth.

<a id="defense-patterns"></a>
### 🛡️ Defense Patterns

**1. Never use DEX spot price as an oracle.** This is the single most important rule. If your protocol reads `reserve1 / reserve0` as a price, it will be exploited.

```solidity
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
uint256 price = (reserve1 * 1e18) / reserve0;

// ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD
uint256 price = getChainlinkPrice(priceFeed);
```

**2. Use Chainlink or equivalent decentralized oracle networks** for any high-stakes price dependency (collateral valuation, liquidation triggers, settlement).

**3. Implement staleness checks** on every oracle read. Choose your `MAX_STALENESS` based on the feed's heartbeat — if the heartbeat is 1 hour, a staleness threshold of 1 hour + buffer is reasonable.

```solidity
// ✅ GOOD: Staleness check
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < MAX_STALENESS, "Stale price");
```

**4. Validate the answer is sane.** Check that the price is positive, non-zero, and optionally within a reasonable range compared to historical data or a secondary source.

```solidity
// ✅ GOOD: Sanity checks
require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
require(answer < MAX_PRICE, "Price too high"); // Optional: circuit breaker
```

**5. Use dual/multi-oracle patterns.** Cross-reference Chainlink with TWAP. If they disagree significantly, pause operations or use the more conservative value.

> **Used by:** [Aave V3](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/misc/AaveOracle.sol) uses Chainlink with fallback sources, [Compound V3](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/main/contracts/Comet.sol) uses primary + backup feeds

**6. Circuit breakers.** If the price changes by more than X% in a single update, pause the protocol and require manual review. [Aave implements price deviation checks](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/misc/AaveOracle.sol) that can trigger sentinel alerts.

**7. For TWAP: require sufficient observation window.** A 30-minute minimum is generally recommended. Shorter windows are cheaper to manipulate.

```solidity
// ✅ GOOD: Enforce minimum TWAP window
uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;
require(timeElapsed >= MINIMUM_WINDOW, "Window too short"); // e.g., 1800 seconds = 30 min
```

**8. For internal accounting: use virtual offsets.** The ERC-4626 inflation attack is defended by initializing vaults with a virtual offset (e.g., minting dead shares to the zero address), preventing the "first depositor" attack.

> **Deep dive:** [ERC-4626 inflation attack analysis](https://mixbytes.io/blog/overview-of-the-inflation-attack), [OpenZeppelin ERC4626 security](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L30-L40)

### 🛠️ Build: Oracle Manipulation Lab

**Workspace:** [`workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise4-spot-price/`](../workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise4-spot-price/) — starter file: [`SpotPriceManipulation.sol`](../workspace/src/part2/module3/exercise4-spot-price/SpotPriceManipulation.sol), tests: [`SpotPriceManipulation.t.sol`](../workspace/test/part2/module3/exercise4-spot-price/SpotPriceManipulation.t.sol)

**Exercise 1: Build the vulnerable protocol.** Create a simple lending contract that reads spot price from a Uniswap V2 pool. Deploy the pool, the lending contract, and demonstrate the attack:
- Fund the pool with initial liquidity
- Take a flash loan (or use `vm.deal` to simulate capital)
- Swap to manipulate the spot price
- Deposit collateral at the inflated valuation
- Borrow more than the collateral is actually worth
- Swap back to restore the price
- Show the protocol is now undercollateralized

```solidity
// Vulnerable lending protocol (for educational purposes)
contract VulnerableLending {
    function getCollateralValue(address token, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        // ❌ VULNERABLE: Using spot price
        IUniswapV2Pair pair = IUniswapV2Pair(factory.getPair(token, WETH));
        (uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1, ) = pair.getReserves();
        uint256 spotPrice = (reserve1 * 1e18) / reserve0;
        return amount * spotPrice / 1e18;
    }
}

// Attacker contract
contract Attacker {
    function attack() external {
        // 1. Flash loan Token A
        // 2. Swap A → B (manipulate price up)
        // 3. Deposit B as collateral (now valued at inflated price)
        // 4. Borrow maximum based on inflated value
        // 5. Swap B → A (restore price)
        // 6. Repay flash loan
        // 7. Keep borrowed funds - profit!
    }
}
```

**Exercise 2: Fix the vulnerability.** Replace the spot price oracle with your Chainlink consumer from the Oracle Fundamentals section. Re-run the attack — it should fail because Chainlink's price doesn't move in response to the attacker's DEX swap.

```solidity
// ✅ FIXED: Using Chainlink
function getCollateralValue(address token, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
    address priceFeed = priceFeedRegistry[token];
    uint256 price = getChainlinkPrice(priceFeed);
    return amount * price / 1e18;
}
```

**Exercise 3: TWAP attack cost analysis.** Using your TWAP oracle from the TWAP Oracles section, calculate (on paper or in a test): how much capital would an attacker need to sustain a 10% price manipulation over a 30-minute window, given a pool with $10 million TVL? How much would they lose to arbitrageurs? This exercise builds intuition for TWAP security margins.

**Exercise 4: Stale price exploit.** Using a mainnet fork, mock a Chainlink feed going stale (use `vm.mockCall` to return old `updatedAt`). Show how a protocol without staleness checks can be exploited when the real market price has moved significantly.

```solidity
function testStaleOracleExploit() public {
    vm.createSelectFork(mainnetRpcUrl);

    // Mock Chainlink returning stale price
    uint256 stalePrice = 3000e8; // $3000
    uint256 staleTimestamp = block.timestamp - 3 hours; // Very stale

    vm.mockCall(
        ethUsdFeed,
        abi.encodeWithSelector(AggregatorV3Interface.latestRoundData.selector),
        abi.encode(1, int256(stalePrice), 0, staleTimestamp, 1)
    );

    // Protocol without staleness check accepts this
    // Attacker can deposit collateral at stale $3000 when real price is $2400
    // Then borrow against inflated value
}
```

### 📋 Summary: Oracle Manipulation Attacks

**✓ Covered:**
- Four attack patterns: spot price manipulation (flash loan), TWAP manipulation (multi-block), stale oracle exploitation, donation/balance manipulation
- Oracle Extractable Value (OEV): oracle updates as MEV opportunity, emerging solutions (API3, Pyth Express Relay, UMA Oval)
- Real exploits: Harvest ($24M), Cream ($130M), Inverse ($15M), Venus ($11M), Euler ($197M)
- Eight defense patterns: no spot price, use Chainlink, staleness checks, sanity validation, dual oracle, circuit breakers, minimum TWAP window, virtual offsets
- Built vulnerable protocol and fixed it with Chainlink
- Stale price exploit simulation with `vm.mockCall`

**Complete:** You now understand oracles as both infrastructure (how to consume safely) and attack surface (how manipulation works and how to defend).

#### 💼 Job Market Context — Oracle Security

**What DeFi teams expect you to know:**

1. **"You're auditing a protocol that uses `pair.getReserves()` for pricing. What's the risk?"**
   - Good answer: It can be manipulated with a flash loan
   - Great answer: Any protocol reading DEX spot price (`reserve1/reserve0`) for financial decisions is trivially exploitable. An attacker flash-loans massive capital (zero cost), swaps to distort reserves, exploits the protocol's reaction to the manipulated price, then unwinds. Cost: just gas. This is the Harvest Finance / Cream Finance / Inverse Finance pattern. The fix depends on the use case: for high-stakes decisions (collateral valuation, liquidation), use Chainlink. For supplementary checks, use a TWAP with a sufficiently long window (30+ minutes). Never trust any same-block-manipulable value.

2. **"How would you detect an oracle manipulation attempt in a live protocol?"**
   - Good answer: Compare the oracle price to a secondary source
   - Great answer: Defense in depth: (1) Dual-oracle deviation check — if Chainlink and TWAP disagree by more than a threshold, pause. (2) Price velocity check — if the oracle-reported price moves more than X% in a single update, flag it. (3) Position size limits — cap the maximum collateral/borrow in a single transaction to limit the damage from any single oracle-dependent action. (4) Time-delay on large operations — require a delay between depositing collateral and borrowing against it (MakerDAO's OSM does this at the oracle level). (5) Monitor for flash loan + oracle interaction patterns off-chain.

**Interview Red Flags:**
- 🚩 Can't explain why `balanceOf()` or `getReserves()` is dangerous as a price source
- 🚩 Doesn't know about the donation/inflation attack vector on vault share prices
- 🚩 Can't name at least one real oracle exploit and explain the attack flow

**Pro tip:** In a security review, trace every price source to its origin. For each one, ask: "Can this be manipulated within a single transaction?" If yes, that's a critical vulnerability. If it requires multi-block manipulation, calculate the cost — if it's cheaper than the potential profit, it's still a vulnerability.

#### 💼 Job Market Context — Module-Level Interview Prep

**What DeFi teams expect you to know:**

1. **"Design the oracle system for a new lending protocol"**
   - Good answer: Use Chainlink price feeds with staleness checks
   - Great answer: Primary: Chainlink feeds per asset with per-feed staleness thresholds based on heartbeat. Secondary: on-chain TWAP as cross-check — if Chainlink and TWAP disagree by >5%, pause new borrows and flag for review. Circuit breaker: if price moves >20% in a single update, require manual governance confirmation. For L2: sequencer uptime feed + grace period. Fallback: if Chainlink is stale beyond threshold, fall back to TWAP if it passes its own quality checks, otherwise pause. For LST collateral (wstETH): chain exchange rate oracle × ETH/USD from Chainlink, with a secondary market-price check.

2. **"Walk through how the Harvest Finance exploit worked"**
   - Good answer: They manipulated a Curve pool price with a flash loan
   - Great answer: The attacker flash-loaned USDT/USDC, made massive swaps in Curve's Y pool to temporarily move the stablecoin ratios, then deposited into Harvest's vault which read the manipulated Curve pool as its price oracle for share price calculation. The vault minted shares at the inflated price. The attacker unwound the Curve swap, restoring the true price, and withdrew their shares at the correct (lower) price — netting $24M. The fix: never use any pool's spot state as a price source.

**Interview Red Flags:**
- 🚩 Proposing a single oracle source without a fallback strategy
- 🚩 Not knowing the difference between arithmetic and geometric mean TWAPs
- 🚩 Thinking Chainlink is "real-time" (it updates on deviation threshold + heartbeat)
- 🚩 Not considering oracle failure modes in protocol design
- 🚩 Not knowing about oracle governance risk (who controls the feed multisig)
- 🚩 Using the same oracle approach for ETH and LSTs (wstETH needs chained oracle + de-peg check)

**Pro tip:** Oracle architecture is a senior-level topic that separates protocol designers from protocol consumers. If you can draw the full oracle flow (data sources → Chainlink nodes → OCR → proxy → your wrapper → your core logic) and explain what can go wrong at each layer, you demonstrate the systems-level thinking that DeFi teams value most. Bonus points: mention OEV as an emerging concern — showing awareness of oracle-triggered MEV signals that you follow the cutting edge.

<a id="common-mistakes"></a>
### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

These are the oracle integration mistakes that appear repeatedly in audits, exploits, and code reviews:

**1. No staleness check on Chainlink feeds**
```solidity
// ❌ BAD: Trusting whatever latestRoundData returns
(, int256 answer, , , ) = feed.latestRoundData();
return uint256(answer);

// ✅ GOOD: Full validation
(uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = feed.latestRoundData();
require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
require(updatedAt > 0, "Round not complete");
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < MAX_STALENESS, "Stale price");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale round");
```

**2. Hardcoding decimals to 8**
```solidity
// ❌ BAD: Assumes all feeds use 8 decimals
uint256 normalizedPrice = uint256(answer) * 1e10; // scale to 18 decimals

// ✅ GOOD: Read decimals dynamically
uint8 feedDecimals = feed.decimals();
uint256 normalizedPrice = uint256(answer) * 10**(18 - feedDecimals);
```

**3. Using DEX spot price as oracle**
```solidity
// ❌ BAD: Flash-loanable in one transaction
(uint112 r0, uint112 r1, ) = pair.getReserves();
uint256 price = (r1 * 1e18) / r0;

// ✅ GOOD: External oracle immune to same-tx manipulation
uint256 price = getChainlinkPrice(priceFeed);
```

**4. No L2 sequencer check**
```solidity
// ❌ BAD on L2: Trusting feeds during sequencer downtime
uint256 price = getChainlinkPrice(feed);

// ✅ GOOD on L2: Check sequencer first
require(isSequencerUp(), "Sequencer down");
require(timeSinceUp > GRACE_PERIOD, "Grace period");
uint256 price = getChainlinkPrice(feed);
```

**5. Using `MAX_STALENESS` that doesn't match the feed's heartbeat**
```solidity
// ❌ BAD: Generic 24-hour staleness for a 1-hour heartbeat feed
uint256 constant MAX_STALENESS = 24 hours;

// ✅ GOOD: heartbeat + buffer
uint256 constant MAX_STALENESS = 1 hours + 15 minutes; // 4500 seconds for ETH/USD
```

**6. No fallback strategy for oracle failure**
```solidity
// ❌ BAD: Entire protocol reverts if oracle fails
uint256 price = getChainlinkPrice(feed); // reverts on stale → protocol freezes

// ✅ GOOD: Fallback to secondary source or safe mode
try this.getChainlinkPrice(feed) returns (uint256 price) {
    return price;
} catch {
    return getTWAPPrice(); // or pause new borrows, or use last known good price
}
```

---

## 📋 Key Takeaways for Protocol Builders

**1. The oracle is your protocol's weakest link.** A perfectly written smart contract using bad price data is just as exploitable as a buggy contract. Oracle choice and integration deserve as much attention as your core logic.

**2. Never derive prices from spot ratios in DEX pools.** This rule has no exceptions for protocols where incorrect prices lead to financial loss.

```solidity
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
uint256 price = reserve1 / reserve0;

// ✅ DO THIS
uint256 price = chainlinkFeed.latestRoundData().answer;
```

**3. Always validate oracle data.** At minimum: positive answer, complete round, fresh timestamp. Optionally: price within historical bounds, cross-reference with secondary source.

**4. Chainlink is the default for production protocols.** It's not perfect (heartbeat lag, centralization concerns), but it's the most battle-tested option. Supplement with TWAP or other sources for defense in depth.

**5. Design for oracle failure.** What happens if your oracle goes down entirely? Your protocol needs a graceful degradation path — pause operations, use a fallback source, or enter a safe mode.

**6. L2 sequencer awareness.** If deploying on Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or other L2s with a sequencer, always check the [Sequencer Uptime Feed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) before trusting price data.

**7. Understand your oracle's trust model.** Chainlink's multisig controls feed configuration. Pyth relies on your transaction including fresh price data. Each model has different failure modes and governance risks. Know what you're trusting.

**8. LST collateral needs chained oracles.** For wstETH, rETH, and other liquid staking tokens, you need both the internal exchange rate and the market rate. Use the more conservative of the two to protect against de-peg events.

**9. Oracle updates create extractable value.** Every time an oracle price crosses a liquidation threshold, MEV searchers profit from backrunning the update. As OEV solutions mature (API3, Pyth Express Relay, UMA Oval), capturing this value becomes a competitive advantage for your protocol.

| Module 7 (Yield/Vaults) | Share price manipulation | Donation attacks on ERC-4626 vaults are an oracle problem — protocols reading vault prices need defense |
| Module 8 (Security) | Oracle threat modeling | Oracle manipulation as a primary threat model for invariant testing and security reviews |
| Module 8 (Security) | MEV / OEV | Oracle extractable value — oracle updates triggering liquidations as MEV opportunity |
| Module 9 (Integration) | Full-stack oracle design | Capstone requires end-to-end oracle architecture: feed selection, fallback, circuit breakers |
| Part 3 Module 1 (Liquid Staking) | LST pricing | Chaining exchange rate oracles (wstETH/stETH) with ETH/USD feeds for accurate LST collateral valuation |
| Part 3 Module 2 (Perpetuals) | Pyth pull-based oracles | Sub-second price feeds for funding rate calculation; oracle vs mark price divergence |
| Part 3 Module 5 (MEV) | Multi-block MEV | Validator-controlled consecutive blocks make TWAP manipulation cheaper — active research area |
| Part 3 Module 7 (L2 DeFi) | Sequencer uptime feeds | L2-specific oracle concerns: grace periods after restart, sequencer-aware price consumers |
